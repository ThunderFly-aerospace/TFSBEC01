# TFSBEC01 - High efficient power supply with measuring circuit for UAV

There are many devices at unmanned vehicles that require a quality power supply, and it is very useful to know the actual and real consumption of these components. Often, some components require relatively high currents. Our TFSBEC module is designed to provide power to servos, autopilot (flight controller) and other drone accessories. In case the user needs more current or two independent sources on his drone, for example a separate source for avionics and for power-consuming elements (actuators), it is possible to chain these modules.
